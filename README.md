# GMsFEM
GMsFEM Codes (for part of Generalized multiscale finite element methods (GMsFEM) Y Efendiev, J Galvis, TY Hou Journal of computational physics 251, 116-135)


In matlab,  Run Original_GMsFEM, follow functions for coefficient,
right hand side and boundary conditions.

Run GMsFEM_kappa_tilde for modified version with local
eigenvalue problem with \tilde{kappa}

WARNING: This code was built on overlapping and nonoverlapping domain decomposition codes. Therefore some computations are coded in ways closer to domain decomposition than multiscale methods. If your training is in multiscale methods, you may find some procedures odd to you.
